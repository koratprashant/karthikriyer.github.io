		<p>Hey there! I'm Karthik. Currently I'm a final year undergrad at IIT Roorkee. I like to read about Computer Graphics, programming and anything related to Software used in Films! I've been a GSoC candidate twice, once with <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/projects/4838049433780224/">TensorFlow</a> in 2019 and with the <a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5493236614823936">Academy Software Foundation (OpenTimelineIO)</a> in 2020. I've also been a Mentor with TensorFlow in <a href="https://codein.withgoogle.com/archive/2019/organization/6265089057882112/">Google Code-In 2019</a>. I've been to a few hackathons and secured top positions in a few.</p>

    <p>In the Summer of 2020 I interned with JPMorgan Chase & Co. as a Software Engineer. I've been actively involved with <a href="https://mdg.iitr.ac.in/">Mobile Development Group IITR</a>, working on a multitude of projects including Android Development, creative coding, VR and data visualization. Currently I'm the Head of Technology at MDG IITR.</p>

    <p>When I'm not working you'll find me watching movies/tv-series, working on some 3D art on Blender or reading.</p>
